# FLocK
Code and GUI for Feature-driven Local Cell Graph (FLocK): New Computational Pathology based descriptors. 
Our manuscript can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S136184152030267X.

**How to use:**
show_example_v2.m shows how to use the code for FLocK feature extraction, as well as the FLocK visulization.

quantitative_analysis_3d.m shows an example of quantitative analysis of FLocK features (see appendix 2 for details).

Please run FeDeG_GUI.m for the GUI.

Note that in the code we used the name FeDeG to replace FLocK. 

We suggest you use the GUI to decide the parameter for you image at hand first.

Also, if you run into errors regarding PolygonClipper, please rebuild the mex file for your platform.
