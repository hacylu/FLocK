# FLocK
Code and GUI for Feature-driven Local Cell Graph (FLocK): New Computational Pathology based descriptors 

show_exmaple_v2.m shows how to use the code for FLocK feature extraction, as well as the FLocK visulization.
quantitative_analysis_3d.m shows an example of quantitative analysis of FLocK features (see appendix 2 for details).
To use the GUI, please run FeDeG_GUI.m.
Note that in the code we used FeDeG to replce FLocK.
